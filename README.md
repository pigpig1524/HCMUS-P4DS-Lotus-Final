# [Group 1 - Lotus] Final Lab Report: A Study of Remote Work and Its Effects on Employees‚Äô Mental Well-Being


## Introduction
In this project, we investigates the [Remote Work & Mental Health Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/waqi786/remote-work-and-mental-health?fbclid=IwY2xjawFrSKZleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHeONLRrPuU1AbC_pHea8QyWNYYMqW-t0Tw_xZtxvDGbldU1ypWS0-AzKKg_aem_jAr-PidmQqlOTGowulNZBA) to uncover patterns and trends in remote work conditions.

Our primary objective is to examine how working conditions impact employees' mental well-being and provide actionable, data-driven insights for organizations to enhance their work arrangement strategies.
